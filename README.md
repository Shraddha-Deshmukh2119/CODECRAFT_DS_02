## 🛍️ Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Sales Dataset 
<br>

📂 **Repository Overview**<br>
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques applied to a Sales dataset. The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, clean the data, and uncover meaningful insights by examining the relationships between variables and identifying patterns and trends.<br>

📊 **Project Description**<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding the data and preparing it for machine learning or decision-making processes. This project involves:<br>

- **Data Cleaning**<br>
1] Handling missing values.<br>
2] Managing duplicate entries.<br>
3] Formatting and transforming columns.<br>
4] Addressing outliers and inconsistencies.<br>

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**<br>
1] Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.<br>
2] Analyzing trends, distributions, and relationships.<br>
3] Generating visualizations to support findings.<br>
By leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this analysis highlights key insights and trends that can drive strategic decisions.<br>

🛠️ **Tools and Libraries**<br>
The following tools and libraries were used:<br>
- Python
- Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Seaborn: For enhanced visualizations and statistical insights.<br>

📌 **Key Highlights**<br>
1] Data Cleaning:
- Addressed missing values and ensured data consistency.
- Standardized column formats for easier analysis.
- Exploratory Insights:

2] Identified key sales trends and patterns.
- Explored correlations between variables like sales amount, region, and time.
- Visualized data for better understanding and communication.<br>

🚀 **How to Use**<br>
1] Clone the repository:<br>
- git clone https://github.com/Shraddha-Deshmukh2119/CODECRAFT_DS_02.git  <br>

2] Install the required libraries:<br>

  - pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn <br>
    
3] Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step-by-step:
 
🏆 **Future Enhancements**<br>
- Incorporate advanced statistical techniques to strengthen insights.
- Automate the data cleaning process for scalability.
- Integrate machine learning models to predict future sales trends.<br>
